def alpha_beta_pruning(node, depth, alpha, beta, maximizing_player):
    """
    Perform Alpha-Beta Pruning for a given game tree.

    Parameters:
        node: The current node of the game tree (could be a state or index).
        depth: The current depth of the game tree.
        alpha: The best value that the maximizing player can guarantee.
        beta: The best value that the minimizing player can guarantee.
        maximizing_player: Boolean, True if the current player is maximizing.

    Returns:
        The best value for the current player.
